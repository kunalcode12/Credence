**Credence** is a decentralized invoice financing marketplace built on **Solana** and powered by the **Finternet protocol**, transforming real-world receivables into programmable financial assets and bridging trade finance with on-chain liquidity.


##  The Problem We Solve

Global trade finance is broken. Businesses wait 30‚Äì120 days to unlock cash tied up in receivables, while banks offer slow, opaque, and exclusionary financing. At the same time, trillions in invoices sit idle‚Äîilliquid, unproductive, and locked inside centralized systems‚Äîleaving financiers with limited, inefficient ways to deploy capital. What‚Äôs missing is an interoperable financial base layer that can turn receivables into programmable assets, deliver instant liquidity, and ensure transparency at scale. This is where **Solana‚Äôs high-performance rails** and the **Finternet protocol‚Äôs open architecture** come together to transform trade finance into a borderless, on-chain marketplace.

##  Our Solution

Credence introduces a **Solana-native model** for invoice financing that combines trustless infrastructure with real-world trade:

###  Core Features

#### 1. **Invoice Tokenization on Solana**
- **NFT Route**: Each invoice as a unique NFT with embedded metadata on Solana
- **Token-2022 Program**: Advanced fungible tokens with programmable transfer hooks and partial payments
- **Decentralized Storage**: Secure invoice data on Arweave/IPFS with Solana metadata

###  Invoice NFT Lifecycle Demonstration

#### 2. **Decentralized Bidding on Solana**
- **Competitive Financing**: Banks, investors, and DeFi actors bid on invoices in a permissionless marketplace.  
- **On-Chain Transparency**: All bids, allocations, and settlements recorded immutably on Solana.  
- **Infrastructure-Driven Fairness**: Open protocols ensure equal access, leveraging Solana‚Äôs high throughput and low latency.

#### 3. **Smart Escrow Programs (Rust-Powered)**
- **Automated Settlements**: Rust-based Solana programs manage escrowed repayments programmatically.  
- **Secure Distribution**: Escrow logic guarantees financiers receive payouts before invoice closure.  
- **Trustless Finternet Operations**: End-to-end execution without intermediaries, relying on Solana smart contracts.

#### 4. **Transparent Lifecycle Management**
- **On-Chain Visibility**: Complete invoice lifecycle tracked from issuance to repayment on Solana.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Stakeholders receive live, programmatically generated status updates.  
- **Auditable Trail**: Immutable transaction history supports compliance and regulatory verification.
